[Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) argued that a rational man, with his shortcomings of knowledge, will choose to believe in God. This is the safer of the two options presented in his much popular [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager).

Assuming that he is a rational man himself, done the same.

In 2014, a Syrian boyâ€” burned and near dead, claimed that he would tell God about everything. I wonder how many children wanted to do just the same, to complain about their agony, hunger, and uprootedness. I wonder how many of them have already lodged their complaints once they passed away.

I possess neither the naivety nor the purity of soul of those children. Therefore, neither can I submit all my complaints to something either deaf or non-existent, nor I can hope for any justice where such pure souls have failed.

So, I refuse to believe or have faith in God, whatever is at stake.
