Art essentially is a matter of attachment. An attachment that connects one to the very depth of the world.[^1] Zen, on the other hand, is a practice of detachment. When they met in the atmosphere of Asian aesthetics they have created a genre with blends of various flavours. Exploring Zen poetry is like taking a journey through your existential crisis.

It can be deduced naturally that the poets of zen (often priests) walked on a thin line. Their attachment was not of the mundane kind that we know. Artists, in general, are subtly attached to reality with a kind of super-sensibility, a refined type of attachment.

Precisely for the practice of Zen where the goal is to get enlightenment with a true description of reality and cultured detachment, zen poets scrutinised their attachment within the framework of Buddhism. This scrutiny yielded surprising results in terms of art.

# Notes & Highlights: The Poetry of Zen
## Sam Hamill, J.P. Seaton
### Han Shan
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:09
I STAND here and watch the people of this world:  
all against one and one against all,  
angry, arguing, plotting and scheming.  
Then one day, suddenly, they die.  
And each gets one plot of ground:  
four feet wide, six feet long.  
If you can scheme your way out of that plot,  
I’ll set the stone that immortalizes your name

*Page Number: 31*
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:10
I laugh at what he calls poetry: a blind man’s  
rhymes in lukewarm praise of the sun.

*Page Number: 33*
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:10
MY heart’s like the autumn moon,  
reflecting from the clear pure waters of the pool.  
There’s nothing to compare:What can I say?

*Page Number: 33*
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:11
EAST of me, the old lady  
Got rich three or four years ago.  
Used to be poorer than me,  
Now she laughs that I don’t have money.
She laughs that I’ve fallen behind.
I laugh that she’s gotten ahead.
Both of us laughing, no stopping us.
East, and West.

*Page Number: 34*

### Shih Te
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:13
MY poems are poems;
some people call them sermons.
Well, poems and sermons share one thing:
when you read them you’ve got to be careful.
Keep at it. Get into detail.
Don’t just claim they’re easy.
If you were to live your life like that,
a lot of funny things might happen.

*Page Number: 37*

### Li Po
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:16
Zazen on Ching-t’ing Mountain
THE birds have vanished from the sky.
Now the last cloud drains away.
We sit together, the mountain and me,
until only the mountain remains.

*Page Number: 43*

### Wang Wei
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:18
**To Magistrate Chang**

LATE, I love but quietness:
things of this world are no more my concern.
Looking back, I’ve known no better plan
than this: returning to the grove.
Pine breezes loosen my robe.
Mountain moonbeams play my lute.
What, you ask, is Final Truth?
The fisherman’s song strikes deep into the bank.

*Page Number: 46*

### Chiao Jan
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:25
**Inscribed on the Wall of the Hut by the Lake**

IF you want to be a mountain-dweller …
no need to trek to India to find one.
I have a thousand peaks
to pick from right here on the lake.
Fragrant grasses and white cloudshold me here.
What holds you there,
world-dweller?

*Page Number: 54*

### Po Chu-i
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:27
**After Reading Lao Tzu**

“ONE who speaks does not know; one who knows does not speak.”
Thus I have been instructed by the Old Master.
If you tell me the Old Master was one who knew, I ask,
Why did he write five thousand words to explain it?

*Page Number: 58*

### Wu Pen (Chia Tao)
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:29
**Parting with the Monk Ho-lan**
WILD monk, come to make a parting with me.
We sit a while on the sand beside the welling source.
You’ll go a long way on that empty alms bowl,
deep among mountains, treading fallen flowers.
Masterless Ch’an, our own understanding?
When you’ve got it, there’s no place for it but a poem.
This parting’s nothing fated:
orphan clouds just never settle down.

*Page Number: 62*

#### Time：2021-06-28 12:29
**The Swordsman**

TEN long years I’ve honed this sword:
its frost white blade is yet untried.
Today, like any other gentleman,
it’s looking for injustice.

*Page Number: 62*

### Anonymous Sung Dynasty Nun
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:32
SEARCHING for spring all day, I never saw it,
straw sandals treading everywhere
among the clouds, along the bank.
Coming home, I laughed, catching
the plum blossom’s scent:
spring at each branch tip, already perfect.

*Page Number: 68*

### Su Tung-p’o
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:36
**Written to the Tune of “An Immortal Approaching the River”**

WINE at East Bank tonight, sobered up
then started over, getting drunk again.
Got home, a little fuzzy, maybe close to three,
and the houseboy was snoring like thunder.
I knocked at my gate, but nobody answered.
I leaned on my cane and listened to the river.
I hate it!—that even this body’s not mine alone …
Someday I’ll give it all up.
The night moves, the breeze writes
quietly in ripples on the water.
A little boat, leaving here and now,
the rest of my life on the river, on the sea.

*Page Number: 69*

### Yuan Mei
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:40
**Wandering Late at Kulin Temple**

THE single sound of the bell
brings out the whole hall’s monks.
Golden glint of the Buddha’s face
almost the flash of a lamp.
The bodhisattva Dragon Tree is silent,
the wind has died away …
The robes of the monks cast shadows
as the moon begins to rise.
No need to chant to sutrasto make the flowers giggle …
As I lean and listen carefully,
even the stones respond.
How can the Buddha, King of Emptiness,
boast of setting the whole world free?
Here, when spring comes,
he hasn’t freed even half this pond
from thinking long on love.

*Page Number: 73*

#### Time：2021-06-28 12:41
**On the Road to T’ien-t’ai**

WRAPPED, surrounded by ten thousand mountains,
cut off, no place to go …
Until you’re here, there’s no way to get here.
Once you’re here, there’s no way to go.

*Page Number: 74*

### Saigyō
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:56
I’D like to divide
myself in order to see,
among these mountains,
each and every flower
of every cherry tree ^857f42

*Page Number: 93*

#### Time：2021-06-28 16:46
THIS loneliness is
not simply the result
of autumn colors—
even mountain evergreens make
me feel like autumn evening

*Page Number: 98*

### Fujiwara no Ietaka
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:47
EVERYTHING must end.
Thus the day tries to begin
with the morning bell.
But the long night remains,
empty moon still in the sky.

*Page Number: 100*

### The Priest Jakuren
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:47
CALL it loneliness,
that deep, beautiful color
no one can describe:
over these dark mountains,
the gathering autumn dusk.

*Page Number: 101*

### Asukai Masatsune
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:48
I WALKED among stones
through mountains of mountains,
paying no mind
until the flower-trail behind
turned into drifting white clouds.

*Page Number: 103*

### Dōgen Kigen
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:52
EVEN without hearts
and minds, plants wither
with the passing days.
Seeing just how this is so,
we feel a little ashamed.

*Page Number: 104*

#### Time：2021-06-28 16:52
CAST away all speech.
Our words may express it,
but cannot hold it.
The way of letters leaves no trace,
yet the teaching is revealed.

*Page Number: 104*

### Kōhō Kennichi
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:52
HERE in a thatched hut
hidden among mountain peaks,
with barely room for one,
I’m suddenly invaded
by wandering white clouds.

*Page Number: 105*

### Emperor Fushima
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:53
ONLY now I know
that power—greater than storms—
a heart-rending awe
silencing all the pine
sat nightfall on the mountain.

*Page Number: 106*

### Ikkyū Sōjun
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:54
LIKE vanishing dew,
a passing apparition
or the sudden flash
of lightning—already gone—
thus should one regard one’s self.

^411ccb

*Page Number: 110*

#### Time：2021-06-28 16:55
AND what is mind
and how is it recognized?
It is clearly drawn
in sumi ink, the sound
of breezes drifting through pine. ^429dce

#### Time：2021-06-28 16:56
**Face-to-Face with My Lover on Daitō’s Anniversary**

MONKS recite the sutras in honor of the founder,
their many voices cacophonous in my ear.
Afterward, making love, our intimate whispers
mock the empty formal discipline of others.

*Page Number: 111*

#### Time：2021-06-28 16:57
**Elegy**

WE first lay down among flowers
ten years ago and found a timeless rapture.
Sadly, I remember being pillowed by her lap,
all-night love, all eternity in our vows.

*Page Number: 112*

### Anonymous
#### Time：2021-06-28 16:58
TO learn how to die,
watch cherry blossoms, observe
chrysanthemums. ^08a643

### Buson
#### Time：2021-06-28 17:00
IN a bitter wind
a solitary monk bends
 to words cut in stone.

*Page Number: 134*

### Ryōkan
#### Time：2021-06-28 17:01
WHO says my poems are poems?
They aren’t poems at all.
Only when you understand my poems aren’t poems
can we talk poetry.

*Page Number: 136*

#### Time：2021-06-28 17:02
**(Poem in Four Characters)**
ABOVE heaven
big winds

*Page Number: 137*

#### Time：2021-06-28 17:02
I NEVER longed for the wilder side of life.
Rivers and mountains were my friends.
Clouds consumed my shadow where I roamed,
and birds pass high above my resting place.
Straw sandals in snowy villages,
a walking stick in spring,
I sought a timeless truth: the flowers’ glory
is just another form of dust.

*Page Number: 138*

#### Time：2021-06-28 17:03
YOU stop to point at the moon in the sky,
but the finger’s blind unless the moon is shining.
One moon, one careless finger pointing—
are these two things or one?
The question is a pointer guiding
a novice from ignorance thick as fog.
Look deeper. The mystery calls and calls:
No moon, no finger—nothing there at all.

*Page Number: 138*

### Kobayashi Issa
#### Time：2021-06-28 17:09
This world of dew
is only the world of dew—
and yet … and yet … ^47cb78

He is writing about Zen. These Tanka poems are as much koans as they are poems. A central idea of Buddhism is [[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way#Time：2020-11-21 15:39\|anātman]], which is the denial of the existence of self or soul as an indivisible and indestructible unit. Instead, the self we know is a continuous process working through our senses. It is very much material and the self is considered as an illusion.

Therefore, the self, understood through Zen is superbly temporal like a drop of dew or a flash of lightning. It is as elusive as sound painted in ink.

The teaching of Zen, ironically, can produce the opposite of detachment. For example, Saigyō writes:

WINE at East Bank tonight, sobered up
then started over, getting drunk again.
Got home, a little fuzzy, maybe close to three,
and the houseboy was snoring like thunder.
I knocked at my gate, but nobody answered.
I leaned on my cane and listened to the river.
I hate it!—that even this body’s not mine alone …
Someday I’ll give it all up.
The night moves, the breeze writes
quietly in ripples on the water.
A little boat, leaving here and now,
the rest of my life on the river, on the sea.

as the moon begins to rise.
No need to chant to sutrasto make the flowers giggle …
As I lean and listen carefully,

Poetry like this requires a certain emotional quality known as '[[Personal/Entities/Concept/Mono no aware\|Mono no aware]]' which is often translated as 'Love for Impermanence' or 'Patheos of Things'. Impermanence is a core idea of Buddhism. This supplied zen poets with a framework to hone their Mono No Aware.

Then comes the anguish. Even with a solid understanding of Zen philosophy poets often faced situations that caused them pain beyond reason. For Bashō, it was when his older brother presented him a lock of white hair of their late mother:

# Notes & Highlights:  Narrow Road to the Interior and Other Writings
## Matsuo Basho (Translated by Sam Hamill)
### Translator’s Introduction
#### Time：2021-06-26 16:18
Ki-no-Tsurayuki’s co-compiler of the Kokinshū, Mibu-no-Tadamine (868–965), introduced another new term to the Japanese critical canon by praising a quality in certain poems which he called yūgen, a word borrowed from Chinese Buddhist writingto identify “depth of meaning,” a character made by combining the character for “dim” or “dark” with the character identifying a deep, reddish black color. Tadamine use dyūgen to identify “aesthetic feeling not explicitly expressed.” He wanted a term by which to identify subtleties and implications. Over the course of the next hundred or so years, yūgen would also be adopted by Zennists to define “ghostly qualities,” as in ink paintings. But the term’s origin lies within seventh-century Chinese Buddhist literary terminology. As an aesthetic concept, it was esteemed throughout the medieval period. An excellent study of Buddhism and literary arts in medieval Japan, William R. LaFleur’s The Karma of Words, devotes an entire chapter to yūgen.

*Page Number:12*
#### Time：2021-06-26 00:02
The fourteenth-century Zen monk Ikkyū Sōjun wrote, “Ame furaba fure, kazefukaba fuke.” If it rains, let it rain; if the wind blows, let it blow. Bashō spent many years struggling to “learn how to listen as things speak for themselves.” No regrets. He refused to be anthropocentric.

Matsushima ya  
ah Matsushima ya  
Matsushima ya ^83dc7c

This is the sort of poem that can be done once, and once only. But it is quintessentially Bashō, both playful and inspired, yet with a hint of [[Personal/Entities/Concept/Mono no aware\|Mono no aware]], a trace of the pathos of beautiful mortality. A literal translation: “PineIslands, ah! / Oh, Pine Islands, ah! / Pine Islands, ah!” Simple as it is, the poem implies co-dependent origination, physical landscape, and a breathless—almost speechless—reverence.

In Yamagata Province, the ancient temple founded by Jikaku Daishi in 860, Ryūshaku Temple is stone quiet, perfectly tidy. Everyone told us to see it. It meant a few miles extra, doubling back toward Obanazawa to find shelter. Monks at the foot of the mountain offered rooms, then we climbed the ridge to the temple, scrambling up through ancient gnarled pine and oak, gray smooth stones and moss. The temple doors, built on rocks, were bolted. I crawled among boulders to make my bows at shrines. The silence was profound. I sat, feeling my heart begin to open.

Together with Moon Mountain and Bath Mountain, Feather Black Mountain completes the Dewa Sanzan, orThree Holy Mountains of Dewa. This temple is Tendai sect, like the one in Edo on Toei Hill. Both follow the doctrine of shikantaza, “deep-sitting concentration and insight,” a way of enlightenment as transparent as moonlight, its light infinitely increasing, spreading from hermitage to mountain top and back, reverence and compassion shining in everything it touches. Its blessing flows down from these mountains, enriching all our lives.

Sitting in the temple chamber with the blinds raised, we saw the whole lagoon, Mount Chōkai holding up the heavens inverted on the water. To the westthe road leads to the Muyamuya Barrier; to the east it curves along a bank toward Akita; to the north, the sea comes in on tide flats at Shiogoshi. The whole lagoon, though only a mile or so across, reminds one of Matsushima, although Matsushima seems much more contented, whereas Kisakata seems bereaved. A sadness maybe in its sense of isolation here where nature’s darker spirits hide— like a strange and beautiful woman whose heart has been broken.

they’ve survived to still blossom,  
these old cherry trees

Saigyō in poetry, Sōgi in linked verse, Sesshū in painting, Rikyū in the teaceremony— the spirit that moves them is one spirit. Achieving artistic excellence, each holds one attribute in common: each remains attuned to nature throughout the four seasons. Whatever is seen by such a heart and mind is a flower, whatever is dreamed is a moon. Only a barbarian mind could fail to see the flower; only an animal mind could fail to dream a moon. The first task for each artist is to overcome the barbarian or animal heart and mind, to become one with nature.

Mile after mile  
falls away each day I search  
for cherry blossoms

Blossoming cherries,  
a gloomy sky, and, sadly,  
one arborvitae  
My fan for a cup,  
I drink from a downpour  
of cherry blossoms.

Throughout my three days in Yoshino, I enjoyed the opportunity to study cherry blossoms at various hours, predawn to dusk and past midnight when the moon was growing pale. I was too moved to write even one poem, especially when my melancholy heart remembered famous poems by Saigyō and other ancient poets. All my lofty pretenses and ambitions aside, my journey produced no poetry.

### Afterword
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:50
It was during this stay in Ueno that he first began to advocate the poetic principle of karumi, “lightness,” urging his followers to “seek beauty in plain, simple, artless language” by observing ordinary things very closely. Karumi, together with existential Zen loneliness (sabi) and elegantly understated, unpretentious natural beauty (shibumi), characterize his final work. His life had been profoundly shaped by wabi, a principle as much moral as aesthetic, and which suggests a spiritual prosperity achieved through material poverty together with a deep appreciation of things old, worn, modest, and simple

*Page Number:138*
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:51
Near the end of his stay, he wrote a short prose meditation, Genjū-an-no-ki, in which he concludes, “In the end, without skill or talent, I’ve given myself over entirely to poetry. Po Chu-i labored at it until he nearly burst. Tu Fu starved rather than abandon it. Neither my intelligence nor my writing is comparable to such men. Nevertheless, in the end, we all live in phantom huts.”

*Page Number:138*
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:54
He wrote to a friend in Zeze in the spring of 1692, complaining, “Everywhere in this city I see people writing poetry to try to win prizes or notoriety. You can imagine what they write. Anything I might say to them would no doubt end in harsh words, so I pretend not to hear or see them.”

*Page Number:140*
#### Time：2021-06-26 17:57
Bashō’s longtime friend Kyorai asked about the master’s jisei (death poem), and was told, “Tell anyone who asks that all of my everyday poems are my jisei.”

*Page Number:142*
#### Time：2021-06-26 18:00
His fundamental teaching remained his conviction that in composing a poem, “There are two ways: one is entirely natural, in which the poem is born from within itself; the other way is to make it through the mastery of technique.” His notion of the poem being “born within itself” should under no circumstances be confused with its being self-originating. A fundamental tenet of Buddhism runs exactly to the contrary: nothing is self-originating. Bashō’s poems were in fact a natural product of his close observation of the natural relationships of people and things, our presence in “nature.” He prized sincerity and clarity and instructed, “Follow nature, return to nature, be nature.” He had learned to meet each day with fresh eyes. “Yesterday’s self is already worn out!”

# Notes & Highlights: The Poetry of Zen
## Sam Hamill, J.P. Seaton
### Han Shan
#### Time：2021-06-28 12:09
I STAND here and watch the people of this world:  
all against one and one against all,  
angry, arguing, plotting and scheming.  
Then one day, suddenly, they die.  
And each gets one plot of ground:  
four feet wide, six feet long.  
If you can scheme your way out of that plot,  
I’ll set the stone that immortalizes your name

*Page Number: 31*

EAST of me, the old lady  
Got rich three or four years ago.  
Used to be poorer than me,  
Now she laughs that I don’t have money.
She laughs that I’ve fallen behind.
I laugh that she’s gotten ahead.
Both of us laughing, no stopping us.
East, and West.

MY poems are poems;
some people call them sermons.
Well, poems and sermons share one thing:
when you read them you’ve got to be careful.
Keep at it. Get into detail.
Don’t just claim they’re easy.
If you were to live your life like that,
a lot of funny things might happen.

**To Magistrate Chang**

LATE, I love but quietness:
things of this world are no more my concern.
Looking back, I’ve known no better plan

Pine breezes loosen my robe.
Mountain moonbeams play my lute.
What, you ask, is Final Truth?
The fisherman’s song strikes deep into the bank.

**Inscribed on the Wall of the Hut by the Lake**

IF you want to be a mountain-dweller …

**Parting with the Monk Ho-lan**
WILD monk, come to make a parting with me.
We sit a while on the sand beside the welling source.
You’ll go a long way on that empty alms bowl,
deep among mountains, treading fallen flowers.
Masterless Ch’an, our own understanding?
When you’ve got it, there’s no place for it but a poem.
This parting’s nothing fated:
orphan clouds just never settle down.

**Written to the Tune of “An Immortal Approaching the River”**

WINE at East Bank tonight, sobered up
then started over, getting drunk again.
Got home, a little fuzzy, maybe close to three,
and the houseboy was snoring like thunder.
I knocked at my gate, but nobody answered.
I leaned on my cane and listened to the river.
I hate it!—that even this body’s not mine alone …
Someday I’ll give it all up.
The night moves, the breeze writes
quietly in ripples on the water.
A little boat, leaving here and now,
the rest of my life on the river, on the sea.

**Wandering Late at Kulin Temple**

THE single sound of the bell
brings out the whole hall’s monks.
Golden glint of the Buddha’s face
almost the flash of a lamp.
The bodhisattva Dragon Tree is silent,
the wind has died away …
The robes of the monks cast shadows
as the moon begins to rise.
No need to chant to sutrasto make the flowers giggle …
As I lean and listen carefully,
even the stones respond.
How can the Buddha, King of Emptiness,
boast of setting the whole world free?
Here, when spring comes,
he hasn’t freed even half this pond
from thinking long on love.

No moon, no finger—nothing there at all.

# শিল্পভাবনা ১: হৃদয়বৃত্তি

শিল্প বা আর্ট কীভাবে শিল্প হয়ে ওঠে তা নিয়ে ভাবনাচিন্তার অন্ত নেই। শিল্পের ধরণ অনুযায়ী তা নিয়ে ভিন্ন ভিন্ন আলোচনা আছে। তর্ক আছে যেমন কুতর্কও আছে। 'সকলেই কবি নয় কেউ কেউ কবি' থেকে কল্পনাকে বলতে গেলে অচ্ছুত করে দিয়ে 'রিয়ালিজম'-এর চর্চাও আছে।

সেসব বাদ দিয়ে মোটাদাগে ভাবলে, শিল্প হচ্ছে শিল্পীর নিজের সত্য (রবীন্দ্রনাথকে প্যারাফ্রেজিং করলে এই দাঁড়ায়)। সংস্কৃত সাহিত্যের ধারায় শিল্পীর মনের একটা 'ভাব' থাকে, বাহ্যিক বিভিন্ন ঘটনা ও বিষয় থেকে 'রস' এসে সেই ভাবটিকে প্রভাবিত করে নতুন ভাবের জন্ম দেয়। তার প্রকাশ হলো শিল্প। এই পর্যন্ত ধরলে শিল্প হৃদয়বৃত্তি। তবে আমি মনে করি শিল্পে বুদ্ধিবৃত্তির একটা বড় জায়গা আছে। একথা অনেকেই মানতে নারাজ। তবে আজ পর্যন্ত যারা তাদের কাজ দিয়ে জায়গা করে নিয়েছে, ধরে রেখেছে কয়েকশো বছর তাদের মধ্যে পথভ্রষ্ট, শয়তান সকলরকমের শিল্পী-সাহিত্যিক দেখেছি, মূর্খ একটিও দেখিনি।

সে বুদ্ধিবৃত্তির আলোচনা পরে করা যাবে। আমরা আপাতত হৃদয়বৃত্তির দিকে দেখি। শিল্পীর হৃদয়বৃত্তি আর দশজনের হৃদয়বৃত্তির মত না। অনুভূতির মূল যন্ত্রপাতি, মানে মস্তিষ্কের পুরনো অংশ আমরা আমাদের সরীসৃপ ও স্তন্যপায়ী জ্ঞাতির সাথে শেয়ার করে এসেছি। আমাদের হিংসা কুমীরের থেকে কিছু একটা আলাদা না। সন্তানের প্রতি ভালোবাসায় বাবা-মা শিম্পাঞ্জির মতই। শুধু প্রকৃতিপ্রদত্ত অনুভূতির ওপর নির্ভরশীল হলে এই হৃদয়বৃত্তি বেশিদিন চালানো যায় না।

তো শিল্পীর একধরণের যত্ন করে গড়ে তোলা হৃদয়ের প্রয়োজন পড়ে। তার মূলে থাকে একধরণের বোধ। সে কেমন বোধ? জাপানিজরা সেই বোধকে বলে '[[Personal/Entities/Concept/Mono no aware\|Mono no aware]]'। জীবন ও জগতের প্রতি একধরণের বিস্ময়পূর্ণ দুঃখবোধ। একদিন হঠাৎ ভোরে সূর্যোদয়, অথবা আশ্বিনের রাতের আকাশের গাঢ় নীলে অজস্র তারা, কিংবা হঠাৎ একদিন সোডিয়াম বাতির নীচে দাঁড়ালে, কাজের শেষে, জাগতিকতার শেষে হঠাৎ মুখ থেকে যে 'আহ্' বেরিয়ে আসে, কিংবা সারি সারি মৃত্যু, জীবনের অপচয় দেখে যে দুঃখবোধ হয়- গভীর ও ইন্দ্রীয়াতীত, সেটাকে গ্রহণ করার ক্ষমতাই শিল্পীর হৃদয়বৃত্তির মূল বিষয়। ^715f40

বিস্ময় বলতে গেলে শিল্পের শেষ কথা। আপনি হয়ত বলতে পারেন যেই বিস্ময়ে রবীন্দ্রনাথ লেখেন 'কী ফুল ঝরিল বিপুল অন্ধকারে' তার সাথে [[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/Narrow Road to the Interior and Other Writings#^83dc7c\|বাশোর হাইকুর]] হয়ত মিল আছে, গঘ্ এর [[Personal/Writings/Creative/Prose/The Starry Night সেকাল-একাল\|স্টারি নাইটের]] মিল আছে, কিন্তু কাফকা? কাফকার আছে জীবনকে খুব গভীরভাবে দেখার ক্ষমতা এবং বিস্ময়বোধ। আমলাতন্ত্র আমাদের বিস্মিত করে না, কদাকার লাগে না বেশিরভাগ সময়, কাফকাকে বিস্মিত করেছিল।

তা বাদে মানুষ লিখে বা এঁকে বাহবা পায় না এমন না। শুধু বুদ্ধিতে মুগ্ধ হয়ে আমরা বলি বাহ্! কিন্তু দ্বিতীয়বার আর তার কাছে ফেরা হয় না। ফিরতে হয় জীবনানন্দের কাছে, কাফকা, রবীন্দ্রনাথ, মানিকের কাছে। দেখতে হয় আরেক মানিকের সিনেমা, শুনতে হয় বাখ্।
