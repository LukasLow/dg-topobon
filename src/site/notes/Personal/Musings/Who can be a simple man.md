A recurring idea in modern writings, literature or scholarly is the spiritual crisis of the modern time. The implication of this crisis is something we have yet to explore much.

## Origin
The origin of this crisis is in the rise of natural science. Physics (especially astrophysics), and evolutionary biology, had put organized religions in a tight position. Now the faith has been demolished for a modern man, intellectuals found themselves deeply disturbed. This phenomenon worked across the globe, and that's also at the same time. Jibananada felt it as much as Pessoa did (though they reacted differently in some important details).

## Effects
The most obvious effect of this crisis is the disorientation, the emptiness left by the dead faiths. [[Entities/Person/Joseph Campbell\|Joseph Campbell]] has expressed the implication of this void quite succinctly in [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell\|The Power of Myth]]:

With the loss of that, we've really lost something because we don't have a comparable literature to take its place. These bits of information from ancient times, which have to do with the themes that have supported human life, built civilizations, and informed religions over the millennia, have to do with deep inner problems, inner mysteries, inner thresholds of passage, and if you don't know what the guide-signs are along the way, you have to work it out yourself. But once this subject catches you, there is such a feeling, from one or another of these traditions, of information of a deep, rich, life-vivifying sort that you don't want to give it up.

Pessoa, though, told us something about how the modern thinking persons **felt** about it:

**Everything we do or say, everything we think or feel, wears the same mask and the same fancy dress. However many layers of clothing we take off, we are never left naked, for nakedness is a phenomenon of the soul and has nothing to do with taking off one’s clothes. Thus, dressed in body and soul, with our multiple outfits clinging to us as sleek as feathers, we live out the brief time the gods give us to enjoy ourselves happily or unhappily (or ignorant of quite what our feelings are), like children playing earnest games.
Someone, freer or more accursed than the rest of us, suddenly sees (though even he sees it only rarely) that everything we are is what we are not, that we deceive ourselves about what is certain and are wrong about what we judge to be right. And this individual, who, for one brief moment, sees the universe naked, creates a philosophy or dreams a religion, and the philosophy is listened to and the religion resonates, and those who believe in the philosophy wear it like an invisible garment, and those who believe in the religion put it on like a mask which they then forget they are wearing.**

Pessoa chose to defend faith in [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Book of Disquiet_ The Complete Edition by Fernando Pessoa\|The Book of Disquiet]] though. But it didn't come naturally and was in stark contrast with his scepticism:

They bring me faith wrapped up like a parcel and borne on someone else’s tray. They want me to accept it, but not open it. They bring me science, like a knife on a plate, with which I will cut the pages of a book of blank pages. They bring me doubt, like dust inside a box; but why do they bring me the box if all it contains is dust? 

</div></div>


This *doublethink* says something about the magnitude of the problem. The faith have something to say about how to cope with #death.

The solutions of the crisis are numerous. Campbell was silent, Jibananada lamenting, Pessoa was confused. On the other hand, some philosophers worked their way to build new paths. Russell is one of them:

**The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.**

Carl Sagan is another, and a more poetic one. He built a whole modern system of living in the [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/Cosmos by Carl Sagan\|Cosmos]].
