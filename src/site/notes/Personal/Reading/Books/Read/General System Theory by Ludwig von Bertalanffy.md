This book neither dives deep into the subject nor is a textbook. It is more of an overview of the subject and a survey of the state of its development.

According to von Bertalanffy, some phenomena can only be understood/interpreted at the system level:[^1]

Nevertheless, the necessity and feasibility of a systems approach became apparent only recently. Its necessity resulted from the fact that the mechanistic scheme of isolable causal trains and meristic treatment had proved insufficient to deal with theoretical problems, especially in the biosocial sciences, and with the practical problems posed by modern technology.

In various branches of science, we encounter systems regularly. Von Bertalanffy's aim was to establish a theory for systems that is applicable to all systems.

Implication of this idea is a [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn#^3d1f04\|paradigm shift]]. But, this is not only an ambitious idea. The author, using his multidisciplinary knowledge, mathematics, and reasoning— has given a sufficiently compelling demonstration of what he wanted to achieve.

I will not agree on everything the author said, though. For example he was unable to see how music, culture etc. are useful for survival:

Greek sculpture, Renaissance painting. German music—indeed, any aspect of culture— has nothing to do with utility, or with the better survival of individuals or nations.

Culture is actually very important for our survival. It enables us to achieve higher, and more complex organization, often spanning lifetimes of multiple generations.

But, these are minor things. His main remains valid. It deeply inspired me to try thinking from a system perspective more.
