### Review
Art is, to me, the most authentic self-expression. Beauty is secondary. Art thrives on our individuality, on our differences. This also implies that art is a mode of living. And how Bashō lived art!  
  
Being a writer myself, I envy Bashō and his time. Yes, it was war-torn medieval Japan. But, people in general are so sincere. Even prostitutes used to utter Haikus. More than that people used to remember poems with their context and history which is, in this age only done by experts. They cherished art and artists. Without so much distractions of our era, a person can live on very little and a poet could have been a hermit.  
  
Bashō lived art in that time. He practiced Zen. He immersed himself in writings of his predecessors. He preached his way of poetry and lived by his rules with absolute honesty. He taught himself to be one with the nature and when he wrote about nature, he wrote about himself.  
  
And, what did he achieved? To me, Bashō is synonymous with excellence.

This edition, part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series, features a masterful translation of this celebrated work. It also includes an insightful introduction by translator Sam Hamill detailing Bashō’s life and the art of haiku, three other important works by Bashō—Travelogue of Weather-Beaten Bones, The Knapsack Notebook, and Sarashina Travelogue—and two hundred and fifty of his finest haiku, making this the most complete single-volume collection of Bashō’s writings. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life.
