To me, this is Alan Moor's greatest work. He is so clear, and so in command of the ideas he wanted to expose, I couldn't find a place where they got watered down which is so much common in comics.

Most of the characters in V for Vendetta are complex. Seldom there are a major character like [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/Bishop Anthony Lilliman\|Bishop Lilliman]] who is typical. So well-crafted the characters are, their inner struggles, and conflicts with the world out that they felt real, yet full of surprise. Moore have shown a mastery in psychology which I consider a hallmark of great fiction writers.

However, characters are only backdrops here. Alan Moore used these characters to effectively convey some very elaborate ideas— freedom, anarchy, justice, etc.

So, when [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/V\|V]] started his vendetta, it is not only against some people. It is against the system, even against the lack of aesthetics that system enforces (hence the theatrical nature of V).

### Volume 01
This issue set up some of the major premises. The world, some of the major characters.

Moore used Evey as his medium to express certain key points of V for Vendetta, namely, how England came to be under fascist rule, and what it meant for common people—distress, torment, and docility.

Secondly, it gives us the first taste of how [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/The Government\|the government]] works.

Thirdly, [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/V\|V]] takes his theatric entry and persists on this aspect of his character. This issue also sheds some light on his origin.

### Volume 02
This issue gave us a monologue by the [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/Adam James Susan\|leader]] which is very revealing.

Although evil, the leader is a sincere person. He simply puts *all* before the *individual* (including himself). If we consider the romantic attraction he feels for [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/Fate\|Fate]] perverse, then he is also a neurotic.

V puts *freedom* over *law and justice*. In his monologue in **Volume 02**, before destroying the sculpture of justice, he eloquently expounded his view on this matter. 

</div></div>


This issue also saw the murder of [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/Bishop Anthony Lilliman\|Bishop Anthony Lilliman]].
### Volume 03
Issue 03 shows the rather [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/V#Delia Surridge\|doleful murder of Delia Surridge]], and [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/V\|V]]'s origin has been explained from [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/Delia Surridge\|Delia Surridge]]'s diary entries.

In a world without political freedom, personal freedom, and precious little faith in anything, comes a mysterious man in a white porcelain mask who fights political oppressors through terrorism and seemingly absurd acts in this gripping tale of the blurred lines between ideological good and evil.
