তপোবন (Topobon) can be loosely translated to forest-hermitage. In Indian myths, there are numerous mentions of topobons.

This is my Topobon, my [digital garden](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/), my hermitage (or probably not).

Thoughts here are, like every thought, ever-changing.

## Maturity Level
Maturity level for each note is being represented by plant icons like these:
  1. Seedling (![Maturity Level: 1|10x16](https://topobon.utsob.me/img/tree-1.svg)): Just started.
  2. Sapling (![Maturity Level: 2|10x16](https://topobon.utsob.me/img/tree-2.svg)): Made some progress and have some coherence.
  3. Tree (![Maturity Level: 3|10x16](https://topobon.utsob.me/img/tree-3.svg)): A coherent piece of thought or writing that can be considered completely, even only provisionally.


> [!Warning] 
> Maturity Levels should be considered with a healthy amount of scepticism since they are purely subjective.
