তপোবন (Topobon) can be loosely translated to forest-hermitage. In Indian myths, there are numerous mentions of topobons.

This is my Topobon, my [digital garden](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/), my hermitage (or probably not).

Thoughts here are, like every thought, ever-changing.

## Maturity Levels
Maturity level for each note is being represented by plant icons of various growth.

### Seedling ![Maturity Level: 1|20](https://topobon.utsob.me/img/tree-1.svg)
Seedlings are thoughts barely started. Maybe Jotted down on haste or simply showing only the brief amount of what I thought about it by far.

### Sapling ![Maturity Level: 2|20](https://topobon.utsob.me/img/tree-2.svg)
Saplings have a substantial amount of content but much work to be done. Coherence and patterns are just emerging in it.

### Tree ![Maturity Level: 3|20](https://topobon.utsob.me/img/tree-3.svg)
Trees are grown up coherent piece of thought/essay/expression that should not change much except for some editorial enhancements.


> [!Warning] 
> Maturity Levels are subjective. It might only means that I'm a very immature person.

## Discussion
Digital gardens are not about marketing/expressing opinion/prophesize etc. It is about nurturing our thoughts publicly and collectively. To discuss with me, there are two ways.

### Emails
From any note's page, click the email button on the bottom right to start an email thread. This is private.

### Comments
Every note has a comment section powered by Disqus. Feel free to use that if you don't mind public discussions.

### Policy
I don't seek publicity. If you find anything praiseworthy (I doubt you will), tell me privately. For commenting, these are the basic rules I believe not too much to abide by:
1. Constructive Criticism.
2. Adhere to the rules of arguments. To name a few:
    1. No personal attack (it's a fallacy)
    2. Other logical fallacies
    3. Avoid irrelevance.
3. Be civil, please.
