তপোবন (Topobon) can be loosly translated to forest-hermitage. In indian myths there are numerous mentions of topobons.

This is my Topobon, my [digital garden](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/), my hermitage (or probably not).

Thoughts here are like every thought, ever-changing.
