[Rabindranath Tagore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath%20Tagore) is undoubtedly the most important polymath of Bengal.[^1] He wrote prolifically, painted, preached pacifism, questioned well-established values, and brought Bengali literature to modernity.

He had an unusual amount of foresight of how the history will unfold. He preached anti-nationalism even before the WWII started.

## Tagore and Modernity
Some might argue that modern Bengali literature starts right after Tagore. I think that's plainly wrong. The shift of motifs and expression that marks the beginning of modern Bengali literature starts from some of Tagore's work from the later part of his life, for example, all the pieces from [Lipika](https://www.tagoreweb.in/Stories/lipika-147) are prose-verses. Poems from [Punashcho](https://www.tagoreweb.in/Verses/punashcho-91), especially [Baanshi](https://www.tagoreweb.in/Verses/punashcho-91/bashi-1985) are modern in their imagery, motifs, and psychology.
