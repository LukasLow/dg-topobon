Adam James Susan is the leader of the **Norsefire** and the leader of the [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/The Government\|government]].

## Characteristics
Although evil, the leader is a sincere person. He simply puts *all* before the *individual* (including himself). If we consider the romantic attraction he feels for [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/Fate\|Fate]] perverse, then he is also a neurotic.
