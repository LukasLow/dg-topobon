**Bishop Anthony Lilliman** is one of the main villains of [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/V for Vendetta by Alan Moore\|V for Vendetta by Alan Moore]].

In contrast to other major characters of this work, he is simple in composition. So much so that you can consider an archetype for major religion's clergymen. Hypocrisy, collaboration with the [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/The Government\|government]], perverse sexuality[^1] everything is present in his character.

[^1]: Pedophilia in this case.
