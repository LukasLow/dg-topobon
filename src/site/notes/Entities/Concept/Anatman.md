The Buddhist concept of **Anattā** categorically denies the existence of a transcendent self (e.g. soul) that found amongst almost all other major religions. Self, as taught by Buddha, is an aggregation of senses and intellect.

## Significance
### In religion
With this concept, Buddhism diverged from virtually every other major religion. 
### In psychology
With the understanding of Anattā, comes a radically different set of axioms to live the life by. However, understanding this concept both intellectually and emotionally is not an easy feat.
### Philosophy
Many philosophers like [Nāgārjuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81g%C4%81rjuna "Nāgārjuna") did [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way\|impressive work]] on this concept, [[Personal/Reading/Notes and Highlights/The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way#XVIII Examination of Self and Entities\|expounding thoroughly]] and building a system of theological understanding.
### Art
Various branches of Zen art and literature depends on this concept not only as a subject,[^1] but as a core philosophy that shape the aesthetic choices. This, and the concept of dependant-origination, provides the basic framework for [[Entities/Concept/Mono no aware\|mono no aware]].
